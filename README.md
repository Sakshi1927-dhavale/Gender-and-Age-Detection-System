ðŸ§  Gender and Age Detection App

This project is a simple and interactive web application that predicts the gender and age group of a person from an uploaded image.  
It uses Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) powered by OpenCV and a friendly Streamlit interface for real-time inference.  
The app automatically detects faces in the image and provides predictions with high confidence.

Key Features:
- Face detection using OpenCV's deep learning models
- Age and Gender classification
- Easy-to-use drag-and-drop image upload
- Clean and responsive web interface built with Streamlit

Technologies Used:
- Python
- OpenCV
- Streamlit
- NumPy
- Pre-trained Caffe models for age and gender
